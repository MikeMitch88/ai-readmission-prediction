Pipeline Overview
Stage 1: Data Cleaning & Validation

Remove duplicate patient records
Validate physiological ranges (age, vital signs, lab values)
Clean outliers using clinical knowledge
Ensure data quality and consistency

Stage 2: Missing Value Imputation

Categorical variables: Mode imputation for insurance type, discharge disposition
Vital signs: Median imputation (clinically stable measures)
Lab values: KNN imputation (values are correlated)
Social determinants: Forward fill assuming stability over time

Stage 3: Feature Engineering (Clinical Domain Knowledge)
Demographic Features:

Age groups, elderly indicator
Gender-specific clinical thresholds

Clinical Severity Features:

Abnormal vitals indicator
Pulse pressure (cardiovascular risk)
Anemia detection (gender-specific)
Estimated GFR for kidney function
Electrolyte imbalance detection

Comorbidity & Complexity:

High comorbidity indicator (≥3 conditions)
Polypharmacy flag (≥5 medications)
Medication burden normalized by age

Admission Pattern Features:

Frequent flyer identification
Recent admission history
Length of stay categories
Weekend/seasonal admission patterns

Social Risk Assessment:

Composite social risk score
Transportation and housing stability
Insurance status impact

Interaction Features:

Elderly + emergency admission
Comorbidity + age interactions
Social + medical risk combinations

Stage 4: Categorical Encoding

Label encoding for binary variables
One-hot encoding for multi-class categories
Handles new categories in test data

Stage 5: Feature Normalization

StandardScaler for numerical features
Preserves fitted parameters for test data

Key Features of the Pipeline

Clinical Relevance: All features are based on established clinical risk factors for readmission
Robust Handling: Manages missing data, outliers, and data quality issues
Scalable: Designed to work with real EHR data at scale
Interpretable: Creates meaningful features that clinicians can understand
Production Ready: Includes fit/transform pattern for training/testing

Generated Features Include

47+ engineered features from raw EHR data
Clinical risk indicators (anemia, kidney disease, hypertension)
Social determinants integration
Temporal patterns (admission timing)
Interaction terms for complex relationships

The pipeline transforms raw EHR data into a clean, feature-rich dataset ready for machine learning model training. Each feature is clinically motivated and contributes to predicting readmission risk.
